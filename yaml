**Title:** *Swarm Robotics: Boids-Based Cleaning Robots Simulation*

---

### 1. Project Overview  
- Motivation: Inspired by robotic vacuums and swarm robotics.  
- Goal: Demonstrate how multiple simple agents, following local rules, can collectively achieve global coverage.  
- Approach: Combine **Boids model** (separation, alignment, cohesion) with dust cleaning and obstacle avoidance.

---

### 2. Technical Approach  
- **Environment:** 60x60 grid with randomly placed dust (dirty cells) and obstacles.  
- **Agents:** Each robot is modeled as a point with position and velocity.  
- **Swarm Rules:**  
  - Separation: Repulsion from nearby agents (avoid collisions).  
  - Alignment: Adjust heading to match neighbors.  
  - Cohesion: Steer toward group center.  
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Repulsion vectors from nearby obstacles.  
- **Dust Cleaning:** Cells become ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù once visited by a robot.  
- **Coverage Metric:** Percentage of cleaned cells over total free cells.

### 3. Implementation  
- Programming language: **Python**  
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`  
- **Animation:** `matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation`  
- **Interactivity:** Mouse clicks allow modifying environment during simulation.  
- **Parameters:** Number of robots, neighbor radius, dust density, obstacle density, etc.  

*(Include 1‚Äì2 screenshots of the simulation and coverage graph.)*

### 4. Results  
- Robots collectively clean nearly **100% of accessible cells** within ~4000 steps.  
- Coverage increases smoothly, showing emergent group behavior.  
- Swarm behavior avoids clustering in one corner and achieves better coverage than random walk.
